            <P>
              We store your email address so you can create an account and log
              back in. That&apos;s it. We won&apos;t email you, we don&apos;t
              sell your data, and we don&apos;t build a profile on you. Your
              posts stay in your browser — they&apos;re never saved on our
              servers.
            </P>
          </section>

          {/* What we store */}
          <section className="py-8">
            <H2>What we store</H2>
            <P>
              The only personal data we keep is your <strong>email address</strong>,
              held by our auth provider (Supabase) so you can sign in. If you
              connect via X (Twitter) OAuth instead, we store your X account
              identifier in the same way — no password is ever created or stored
              on our end.
            </P>
            <P>
              We also store a record of each audit job you run (when it started,
              how many posts were scanned, how many were flagged) so you can
              return to the results list. We do <strong>not</strong> store the
              content of your posts anywhere on our servers.
            </P>
          </section>

          {/* Tweets / posts */}
          <section className="py-8">
            <H2>Your posts &amp; tweets</H2>
            <P>
              When you run a scan, your posts are fetched from the X API and
              processed on our backend to detect risky content. They pass through
              our servers but are <strong>never saved there</strong>. The full
              scan results — every post, every flag — are written only to your
              browser&apos;s local storage on your device.
            </P>
            <P>
              This means if you clear your browser cache, your results are gone.
              We can&apos;t recover them because we never had them. That&apos;s
              intentional.
            </P>

          {/* Payments */}
          <section className="py-8">
            <H2>Payments</H2>
            <P>
              Payments are processed by <strong>Stripe</strong>. Your card
              number, CVC, and billing details go directly to Stripe — we never
              see or store them. We receive a record of whether a payment
              succeeded and how many credits were purchased; nothing more.
            </P>

          <section className="py-8">
            <H2>Analytics</H2>
            <P>
              We use <strong>Vercel Analytics</strong> for basic, anonymous
              page-view counts and session duration. There is no Google Analytics
              on this site. Vercel Analytics does not track you across other
              sites, does not build ad profiles, and does not do any attribution
              or remarketing. It tells us roughly how many people visited a page —
              that&apos;s all.
            </P>

          {/* Contact / changes */}
          <section className="pt-8">
            <H2>Contact &amp; changes</H2>
            <P>
              We won&apos;t contact you. If this policy changes, we&apos;ll
              update this page with a new date at the top. Continuing to use the
              service after a change means you&apos;ve accepted it.
            </P>
